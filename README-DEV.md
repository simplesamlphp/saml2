# Notes for the SimpleSAMLphp SAML2 developer

## Coding standards

PSR-0, PSR-1 and PSR-12.
Test with the PHPCS configuration in `tools/phpcs/ruleset.xml`
(note if you have PHPStorm you can use this to turn on the PHPCS inspection).

## Testing

Use PHPUnit for Unit Testing.
Test with the 2 known users: [SimpleSAMLphp][1] and [OpenConext-engineblock][2].

### Using Tests in Development

In order to run the unittests, use `vendor/bin/phpunit`
